# Review Questions

## What is Node.js?

* Node.js is not just a runtime environment, it's a mindset. It's an extension of our very JS knowledge. Imagine JS as the hand, with its fingers. Your flesh burns all of the time, so you add some React to cover up all of the ugly stuff. However, the hand doesn't move so we need to start connecting it to the brain, and that's our Node.js. It allows us to start making those connections through webservers/API's.

## What is Express?

* Express is a framework used to handle routes, requests and views, following a MVC organization.

## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

* I have learned about requests, routes and middleware.

## What is Middleware?

* Middleware is a function that fires on request between route handlers and raw requests. They take the next() argument.

## What is a Resource?

* Resources are objects that hold the data that we pull in using the API.

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

* The API will return a 200 response to show the request was successful (OK)

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

* We could use subrouters to break up the app.

## What is CORS and why do we need it?

* CORS is "cross-origin resource sharing" and it allows us to use data and resources from different servers.
